# Visual novel text hooker
An application to extract the text a game is displaying in realtime. 
The objective of this project is for the user to have access to the text stream and be able to outsource it to either their own aplication or a third party service.
A number of quality of life features may also be included in the GUI so you can use it as a standalone app for reading.
