-TargetArgs,
-LocaleEmulatorPath,  # Mandatory
-LanguageName,
-LanguageID,          # Mandatory
-ShortcutFilePath,    # Mandatory

Target should be an absolute path it seems

Path + language Id on settings.json

I just assume the language ids are
0 for Japanese
1 for Japanese (Admin)

ShortcutFilePath is mandatory?
